This is an application created in C# that works on the Machine Language we studied in CS with Dr. Elramly. This is an simulation for the CPU and the Memory as explained in the book.

You can put any code you want and the app will run your code. You can modify anywhere in memory by double clicking on the memory or registry cell. If you want to add an instruction set, you can press on Batch Add Code which will display a new window that you can write your code in. After you write it, you can write the address at which the app will start adding your instruction set.

You can directly modify the Program Counter (PC) and the Instruction Record (IR). You can perform the Fetch, Decode and the Execute operations seperatly or perform them all at once by pressing Run one cycle. You can also run until halt by pressing the button underneath.

The simple view checkbox toggles the display of the memory interpretted as integers (really signed bytes) and floating point numbers (the notation explained in the book.). Lastly If you need to Clear the Memory or the Registers you can either press Delete while selecting a certian cell, or click Clear Memory or Clear Register.


This needs at least .NET framework 2.0 to run.
